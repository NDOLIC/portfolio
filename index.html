        <div class="about me">
            <p>I have over 5 weeks of experience as a software engineer, and have studied computer science in university and got trained in Moringa school. </p>

            <p>I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a senior employer contributor role where I can take on collaborative team leadership responsibilites.</p>
